# <random-password-generator>

## Description

This application should display my Javascript abilities in my own creative and concise way. 

The purpose of this project was to create a password generator using criteria selected by the user. Most of the styling & markup components were already provided. Only a few lines of JS were provide. My goal was to refactor the given code. 

The biggest challenge, by far, was figuring out how to iterate loops to produce desired results. It took me a while to figure out how the FOR loops break or continue. But in doing so, I was able to keep the code short, without having to write multiple or longer IF/ELSE statements. 


## Installation
